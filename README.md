# PracticeProblems
Follow the link to a Github repo for a course I taught at WSU, CPTS 111 Introduction to Algorithmic Problem Solving. 

This is a "CS0" course in Python that has lots of practice problems for topics through list, dictionaries, and tuples. The practice problems are in the following folders:
* labs
* progassignments
* examreviews
